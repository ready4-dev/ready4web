ready4 is an open science toolkit for reproducible, replicable and generalisable mental health modelling.

ready4 consists of open access code libraries and datasets.

The three categories of ready4 code library are:

 - **Development workflow tools** to help standardise and automate common code authoring and data management tasks;
 - **Modelling tools and templates** tools to help standardise and automate common mental health modelling tasks;
 - **Prediction tools** to help forecast population mental health outcomes under varying potential future states.

The initial ready4 suite (all Development workflow tools and some Modelling and Prediction tools) is an outcome of the [readyforwhatsnext](https://readyforwhatsnext.github.io/readyforwhatsnext/index.html) project that has been funded by VicHealth, Orygen and Victoria University and which is led by researchers in Orygen, Victoria University, Deakin University and Flinders University. The suite is expanding with outputs from projects from other funders, who are identified in each project page.

Most of the code libraries in the ready4 suite are currently hosted on GitHub in development versions that are being prepared for documentation prior to public release. A number of them have been documented in a basic fashion by an algorithm we created (human written edits and extensions to this documentation will be produced in 2021) - and are now publicly available.

Development workflow tools for which code libraries are currently publicly available:

 - [ready4fun](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4fun/index.html) tools for function authoring and automated documentation;
 - [ready4class](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4class/index.html) tools for automating the creation and extension of classes; and
 - [ready4use](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4use/) tools for data management and automation of replication dataset distribution; and
 - [ready4show](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4show/) tools for authoring reports. 
 
One modeller workflow toolkit has a development version code library publicly available:

 - [TTU](https://ready4-dev.github.io/TTU/index.html) tools for developing transfer to utility mapping algorithms.
 
One prediction toolkit has a development version code library publicly available:

 - [youthu](https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthu/index.html) tools for predicting adolescent AQoL 6D health utility from a range of anxiety, depression and psychological distress measures.

Source code for all of the above is available in our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/ready4-dev).

Additionally, we are currently in the early stages of developing replication datasets for the projects developed with the ready4 suite. These are hosted on our [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ready4).
