ready4 is a set of scientific computing tools to help identify policies that can better support the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people.

ready4 consists of three categories of code library:

 - Developer workflow tools to facilitate standardisation and automation of code authoring and data management tasks;
 - Modeller workflow tools to standardise and automate common data synthesis, analysis and simulation tasks;
 - Prediction tools to help forecast population mental health outcomes under varying potential future states.

The initial ready4 suite (all Developer Workflow tools and some Modeller workflow and Prediction tools) is an outcome of the readyforwhatsnext project that has been funded by VicHealth, Orygen and Victoria University and which is led by researchers in Orygen, Victoria University, Deakin University and Flinders University. The suite is expanding with outputs from pojects from other funders, who are identified in each project page.

Most of the code libraries in the ready4suite are currently being documented prior to public release. The following code libraries have been documented and are now publicly available:

 - [ready4fun](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4fun/index.html) function authoring and documenting tools;
 - [ready4class](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4class/index.html) tools for creating and extending classes.
