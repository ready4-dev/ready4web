## Readyforwhatsnext
Readyforwhatsnext is a scientific computing project to help identify better policy approaches to support the mental health of children and young people.

There are three components to the readyforwhatsnext project:

- a toolkit to implement reproducible workflows for mental health data synthesis and simulation projects; 
- demonstration models developped for the Australian context that are implemented to be generalisable to other contexts; and 
- user-interfaces, scientific summaries and policy analysis reports.

This repository outlines the publicly available information about the main computational components of this project - principally links to the code libraries and supporting documentation. As additional digital assets from the readyforwhatsnext project are publicly released, this repository will be updated with descriptive information about each release.
