The three categories of ready4 code library are:

 - **Development workflow tools** to help standardise and automate common code authoring and data management tasks;
 - **Modelling tools and templates** tools to help standardise and automate common mental health modelling tasks;
 - **Prediction tools** to help forecast population mental health outcomes under varying potential future states.
 
Most of the code libraries in the ready4 suite are currently hosted on GitHub in development versions that are being prepared for documentation prior to public release. A number of them have been documented in a basic fashion by an algorithm we created (human written edits and extensions to this documentation will be produced in 2021) - and are now publicly available.

Development workflow tools for which code libraries are currently publicly available:

 - [ready4fun](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4fun/index.html) tools for function authoring and automated documentation;
 - [ready4class](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4class/index.html) tools for automating the creation and extension of classes; and
 - [ready4use](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4use/) tools for data management and automation of replication dataset distribution; and
 - [ready4show](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4show/) tools for authoring reports. 
 
One modeller workflow toolkit has a development version code library publicly available:

 - [TTU](https://ready4-dev.github.io/TTU/index.html) tools for developing transfer to utility mapping algorithms.
 
One prediction toolkit has a development version code library publicly available:

 - [youthu](https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthu/index.html) tools for predicting adolescent AQoL 6D health utility from a range of anxiety, depression and psychological distress measures.

Source code for all of the above is available in our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/ready4-dev).
