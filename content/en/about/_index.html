{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-map-marked" title="Conceptual Model" %}}
We developed a [conceptual model](/blog/2021/02/12/readyforwhatsnext-conference-posters-now-available/) to inform the development of the computational model.

The PhD candidature of ready4's project lead <a href = "https://mph-economist.netlify.app">Matthew Hamilton</a> is focused on developing the ready4 <a href = "/docs/framework/">framework</a> and demonstrating its practical utility for implementing valid and useful tools to inform policymaking and system design relating to primary <a href="/docs/model/using-modules/platforms/">mental health services</a> for young people in Australia. The PhD is supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship and, in addition to peer-reviewed publications, aims to produce outputs including <a href = "/docs/getting-started/software/status/production-releases/">production releases</a> of <a href = "/docs/getting-started/software/libraries/types/framework/">framework libraries</a> and a core set of <a href = "/docs/getting-started/software/libraries/types/module/">module libraries</a>, open access <a href="/docs/datasets/">datasets</a>, <a href="/docs/analyses/replication-code/">reproducible analyses</a> and <a href="/docs/analyses/decision-aids/">decision aids</a>.

A number of <a href = "/docs/getting-started/concepts/project/">modelling projects</a> at Orygen, apply, extend and/or supplement the core ready4 modules being developed under the PhD program. <a href = "/docs/examples/">Examples</a> of current and recent projects include those in <a href = "/docs/analyses/replication-code/model-choice/">choice modelling</a> and <a href = "/docs/analyses/replication-code/map-utility/">utility mapping</a>. Each project is independently funded and governed. Details of <a href = "/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/funding/">project funding</a> are available in the citation information, meta-data and acknowledgements of the <a href = "/docs/getting-started/software/libraries/types/module/">module libraries</a>, <a href="/docs/datasets/">datasets</a>, <a href="/docs/analyses/">analyses</a> and manuscripts associated with each project.

<h1 class="text-center">All ready4 <a href = "/docs/getting-started/software/">software</a> to date has been developed by <a href = "https://mph-economist.netlify.app">Matthew Hamilton</a>, Glen Weisner and Caroline Gao.
