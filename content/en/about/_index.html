<h1><b>Catalyst</b></h1>
<h2 class="text-center">In July 2017, with <a href = "/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/funding/">funding support</a> from VicHealth, Orygen and Victoria University, we began to develop a prototype <a href = "/docs/framework/">software framework</a> for implementing an <a href = "/docs/software/terms/licenses/">open source</a> computational model of resilience in young people. At that time, the project was called readyforwhatsnext.</h2>

<h1><b>Minimum Viable Product</b></h1>
<h2 class="text-center">Currently, we aim to <a href = "/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/launch/">develop and release an initial set of modules</a> for a more extensive economic model, <a href = '/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/curate/'>maintain and improve that model </a> and then <a href='/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/apply/'>demonstrate its practical utility</a> for generating <a href = '/docs/examples/'>useful insights for youth mental health decision-makers</a>. We are pursuing these goals as multiple independently funded and governed modelling projects at <a href = 'https://www.orygen.org.au'>Orygen</a> and by an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship funded PhD project at <a href = 'https://research.monash.edu/en/organisations/sphpm-health-economics-group'>Monash University Health Economics Group</a>.

<h1><b>Adoption</b></h1>
<h2 class="text-center">With <a href = "/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/">additional help</a>, we hope to be able to progress longer term goals to <a href = "/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/support/">build a community of users and contributors</a>, <a href = "/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/extend/">extend the ready4 model</a> and <a href = "/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/integrate/">integrate it with other open source tools</a>. </h2>
