A key aspect of the ready4 framework is support for standardised and partially automated workflows for computational model development. The ready4 modelling toolkit is a set of tools to support implementation of these workflows. Currently available (as at  `r format(Sys.Date(),"%d-%b-%Y")`) releases of the R packages that collectively comprise the ready4 modelling toolkit are described below.
