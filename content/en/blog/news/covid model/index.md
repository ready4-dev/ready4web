Combined <em>Springtides</em> and University of Sydney model predictions
{{< /imgproc >}}

One of the preliminary applications of the Springtides model was to provide initial predictions, early in the COVID-19 pandemic about the [potential mental health impacts of the pandemic in the absence of government intervention.](https://www.orygen.org.au/About/News-And-Events/2020/Modelling-predicts-an-additional-82,000-young-Vict). That original analysis was undertaken in May 2020 in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Sydney and was subject to media coverage, both [at the time](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/alarm-raised-over-pandemic-linked-mental-health-crisis-20200514-p54t2z.html) and in [December 2020](https://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/mental-health-of-young-must-be-a-post-virus-priority-20201212-p56mxk.html). 

Code-libraries and datasets for Springtides will be publicly released in the future, but a brief overview of the modelling approach is described from the 55 minute mark of the below webinar.
