International academic conference poster presentations relating to the readyforwhatsnext project have been made available in the project's scientific summaries dataset [https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QBZFQV](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QBZFQV). The two posters that have been uploaded summarise the project's conceptual model and how its systems dynamics model was adapted to develop the Springtides spatial epidemiology simulator.
