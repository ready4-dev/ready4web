**The ready4 framework has reached a major milestone with the inclusion on CRAN of the ready4 foundation library.**

The first of the six libraries that comprise the ready4 software framework is now [available on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ready4/index.html). Thank you to the volunteer peer-reviewers who took the time to review our submissions and help ensure that the library was compliant with all required CRAN policies.
