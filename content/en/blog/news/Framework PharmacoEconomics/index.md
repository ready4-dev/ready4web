**The ready4 framework has achieved another milestone with the publication of the first peer-reviewed article relating to its development and application.**

The first peer-reviewed publication describing the ready4 software framework is now [available in PharmacoEconomics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-024-01378-8). Thank you to the co-authors, advisers and peer-reviewers who helped achieve this outcome.
