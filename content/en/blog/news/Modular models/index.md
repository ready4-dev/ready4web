**The ready4 framework has reached a major milestone with the launch of tools to implement modular models that use a simple and consistent syntax.**

Development version software to implement and extend the ready4 framework has been publicly available for over a year now. However, the way that this code was limited has limited its potential utility as a toolkit for developing transparent and modular mental health systems models. The latest release of the ready4 R package addresses these limitations with two important innovations:

- introducing the concept of modules, to facilitate consistent application of an [Object Oriented Programming](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4/articles/V_03.html) approach throughout the ready4 software suite;

- codifying a simple and consistent syntax for use in all programs that implement configurations of models developed with the ready4 framework.
