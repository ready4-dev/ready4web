  The ready4 prototype software framework supports [computational health economic model](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model/) implementation that meet explicit transparency, reusability and updatability criteria.
---

Transparent, reusable and updatable (TRU) computational health economic models are signifiers of [ethical modelling practice](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14138.pdf). The ready4 software framework provides tools to help implement TRU models.

## Transparent
Model code and data are publicly available in online [code repositories](/docs/software/repositories/) and [data collections](/docs/model/datasets/finding-data/search/). Algorithms are [documented and transparently and regularly tested](/docs/software/libraries/documentation/). Model development occurs [in the open](https://github.com/ready4-dev) and [invites community participation](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/code/), with each individual's [contribution](/docs/contribution-guidelines/) publicly identifiable. [Analyses](/docs/model/analyses/) are [reproducible and replicable](/docs/getting-started/concepts/reproducible-replicable-generalisable/#reproduction-and-replication).

## Reusable
[Model modules](/docs/model/) and [datasets](/docs/model/datasets/) originally developed in one modelling project can be independently [reused](/docs/model/modules/using-modules/) in other projects. As they share a common [framework](/docs/framework/), model modules can be combined in other models and analyses to address [multiple topics](/docs/examples/). [Code implementation paradigms](/docs/framework/implementation/paradigm/) facilitate the [transfer](/docs/getting-started/concepts/transferable/) of model modules for use in other decision contexts.

## Updatable
Model code, data and analyses are versioned, with an ongoing program of making [new and updated releases](/blog/releases/). Software is [maintained](/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/curate/), with opportunities for users and contributors to flag issues, request features and supply [code contributions](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/code/).
