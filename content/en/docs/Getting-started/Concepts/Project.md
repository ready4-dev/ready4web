  A ready4 modelling project develops a computational model, adds data and runs analyses.
---

As a [complex, collaborative and long-term undertaking](/docs/getting-started/motivation/), it is not feasible for ready4 to be financed by a single [funder](/docs/getting-started/stakeholders/funders/) or progressed as a single project. Instead, our mode of development is via multiple independent modelling projects, each with their own project governance and [funding](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/funding/), but which adopt a common [framework](/docs/framework/).

A ready4 modelling project will involve the three steps of:

- Developing and validating a [computational model](../model);

- Adding context-specific [data](/docs/datasets/) to that computational model; and

- Applying the computational model to the supplied data to undertake [analyses](/docs/analyses/).

The key components of each step are [summarised here](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/use/).
