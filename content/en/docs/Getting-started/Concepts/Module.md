  Some [computational models](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model/) are implemented by combining self-contained, reusable components called "modules".
---

A modular [computational model](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model/) is one that constructed from multiple self-contained components, called modules. The advantages of developing a modular model include:

- each module can be [independently re-used in other computational models](/docs/model/modules/using-modules/);

- a complex model can be developed iteratively, beginning with a simple representation that is easier to validate and then progressively expanding in scope and functionality through the [addition of new modules](/docs/framework/use/authoring-modules/), to be validated independently and jointly; and

- long term and resource intensive model development is more feasible through combining multiple [independently managed and financed modelling projects](/docs/getting-started/concepts/project/).

To ensure that all [ready4 computational model modules](/docs/model/modules/) can be [safely and flexibly combined](/docs/framework/implementation/paradigm/object-oriented/#modular-computational-models/), each module is created from a [template](/docs/framework/implementation/modularity/) using [authoring tools that support standardisation](/docs/software/libraries/installation/authoring-tools/code-development/).
