  ready4 is comprised of self-contained, reusable components called "modules".

A modular [computational model](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model/) is one that constructed from multiple self-contained components, called modules. Each ready4 module describes a data structure and the set of algorithms that can be applied to it. 

The advantages of developing ready4 as a modular model include:

- each module can be [independently re-used in other computational models](/docs/model/using-modules/) of the [people](/docs/model/using-modules/people/), [places](/docs/model/using-modules/places/), [platforms](/docs/model/using-modules/platforms/) and [programs](/docs/model/using-modules/programs/) important to the mental health of young people;

- a complex model can be developed iteratively, beginning with a simple representation that is easier to validate and then progressively expanding in scope and functionality through the [addition of new modules](/docs/model/authoring-modules/), to be validated independently and jointly; and

- long term and resource intensive model development is more feasible through combining multiple [independently managed and financed modelling projects](/docs/getting-started/concepts/project/) from [multiple contributors](/docs/contribution-guidelines/).

To ensure that all ready4 modules can be [safely and flexibly combined](/docs/framework/implementation/paradigm/#modular-computational-models), each module is created from a [template](/docs/framework/implementation/modularity/) using [authoring tools that support standardisation](/docs/getting-started/software/libraries/installation/authoring-tools/code-development/).
