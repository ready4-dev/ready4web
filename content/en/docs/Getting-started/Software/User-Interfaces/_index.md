  User interfaces make it easier for non-technical users to explore and use ready4 models.
---

ready4 user-interfaces (UIs) enable individuals, especially planners, to explore, configure and use ready4 tools without needing to enter any computer code. Our applications are typically deployed as Shiny apps an may have deployments via the web (accessed through your browser) or to your desktop (installed as part of a ready4 [library](../libraries/)). 

The main purposes of ready4 user-interfaces are:

- to make it easy for non-technical users to configure a computational model and apply it to selected input data; and

- as an accessible and interactive means of demonstrating key concepts relating to ready4.

The [user interface for exploring the dependencies of ready4 libraries](../libraries/dependencies/) is an example of the latter use.

We do not have any current releases of ready4 user interfaces for running models. However, an old and [deprecated user interface for running the Springtides model](../../../analyses/decision-aids/springtides-app/) is available for purely illustrative purposes.
