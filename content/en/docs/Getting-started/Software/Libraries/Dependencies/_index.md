  Search for ready4 library and function dependencies using our interactive app.
---

As an open-source project, ready4 depends on the software created and shared by others. Using the [DependenciesGraphs R package](http://datastorm-open.github.io/DependenciesGraphs/), we have created the Shiny app below to:

- explore the inter-dependencies between ready4 libraries;
- highlight how our software depends on other R packages;
- itemise the contents each ready4 library;
- display function help files; and 
- map function inter-dependencies across multiple ready4 libraries.
