  ready4 aims to be a valid and useful youth mental health systems model.
---

Improving the mental health and wellbeing of young people is a global public health priority. However, identifying the optimal policy and system design choices to meet this challenge is not straightforward. Valid, contextual and multipurpose models of some of the ways that economic, environmental, healthcare, social and technological systems interact to shape youth mental health are of potentially great use for decision makers. Traditional approaches to computational model development may be insufficient to achieve this goal for reasons that include:

1. Errors, common in even relatively simple health economic models, become more likely as model complexity grows. Much stronger validation and verification processes and increased emphasis on implementing [reproducible and replicable modelling analyses](/docs/analyses/) are therefore required.

2. The scope of more complex models may be beyond the capacity of any single modelling team, making [collaborative development](/community/) more important. Effective collaboration must overcome barriers including:
  - the lack of a common [framework](/docs/framework/) for model implementation, dissemination and reporting makes it more difficult for models to be efficiently and safely combined ; and
  - models of health systems, particularly health economic models, can be hard to generalise to other decision contexts, a challenge that can be partially mitigated through appropriate [code implementation paradigms](/docs/framework/implementation/paradigm/).

3. Financing is typically provided by a single funder for a project with a defined end-point that is focused on producing a relatively small number of pre-specified analyses. In the absence of sustained funding or [a longer term field building initiative](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/funding/), these [modelling projects](/docs/getting-started/concepts/project/) can quickly go out of date, and have limited scope for ongling quality assurance (e.g. bug fixes) or to be re-used or extended for future work.

To help address each of these challenges, ready4 is being implemented as a [modular](/docs/getting-started/concepts/module/), [open source](/docs/getting-started/software/terms/licenses/) [computational model](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model/).
