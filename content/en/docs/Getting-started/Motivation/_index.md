  ready4 aims to be a valid and useful youth mental health systems model.
---

Improving the mental health and wellbeing of young people is a global public health priority. However, identifying the optimal policy and system design choices to meet this challenge is not straightforward. A valid, contextual and multipurpose model of some of the ways that economic, environmental, healthcare, social and technological systems interact to shape youth mental health would be potentially very useful for decision makers. 

However, developing such a model is a major, resource-intensive and long-term undertaking. Traditional approaches to health economic model development are unlikely to be sufficient to achieve this goal for reasons that include:

- the complexity of the task is likely to be beyond the capacity of any single modelling team, so [collaborative development](/community/) is much more important;
- barriers to effective collaboration between modelling teams working on distinct but potentially complimentary projects are the heterogeneous approaches taken to model conceptualisation, implementation, dissemination and reporting - to be efficiently combined, models require some form of a common [framework](/docs/framework/);
- another barrier to modellers reusing each other's work is that models of health systems, particularly health economic models, can be hard to generalise to other decision contexts if they don't adopt [code implementation paradigms](/docs/framework/implementation/paradigm/) to facilitate this goal; 
- project finance is typically provided by a single funder for projects with defined end-points that focus on producing a relatively small number of pre-specified analyses, meaning [a longer term field building initiative](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/funding/) is required to ensure that [modelling projects](/docs/getting-started/concepts/project/) from multiple funders can be combined, re-used, kept up to date and extended; and
- errors, common in even relatively simple health economic models, become more likely as model complexity grows and therefore require much stronger validation and verification processes and increased emphasis on implementing [reproducible and replicable modelling analyses](/docs/analyses/).

To addressing each of these challenges, ready4 is being implemented as a [modular](/docs/getting-started/concepts/module/), [open source](/docs/getting-started/software/terms/licenses/) [computational model](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model/).
