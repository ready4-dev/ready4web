  Researchers can use ready4 to enahnce the [reproducibility, replicability, generalisability](/docs/getting-started/concepts/reproducible-replicable-generalisable/) and reuse of their work.
---

Researchers in multiple discipline enhance prior, current or planned future projects related to how economic, environmental, service, social and technical systems shape young people's mental health by using ready4 to:

- [label and share](/docs/datasets/authoring-data/) non-confidential data (e.g. tables of summary statistics / parameter values) from prior and current work to extend access and impact;
- working with [modellers](/docs/getting-started/users/modeller/) to [undertake modelling analyses](docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/apply/); 
- working with [coders](/docs/getting-started/users/modeller/) to redevelop study analysis scripts by [authoring modules](/docs/model/authoring-modules/) for more [general application and re-use](/docs/getting-started/concepts/reproducible-replicable-generalisable/#generalising);
- supervising student projects to assist with ready4's [current priorities](/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/); and/or
- develop research proposals that incorporate a [modelling project](/docs/getting-started/concepts/project/).

Researchers considering using ready4 should ensure they understand the [development status](/docs/getting-started/software/status/) of the tools they wish to use. If the required software is not yet a [production release](/docs/getting-started/software/status/production-releases/) (a process [we are working on](/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/launch/)!) we'd suggest only using it for testing or exploratory work that is not designed to inform decision making. All our software is [free and open source](/docs/getting-started/software/terms/) so you don't need to ask our permission to use it. We are however, very happy to discuss ideas for potential collaborations - [contact the project lead to arrage a chat](https://mph-economist.netlify.app/#contact).

We also [welcome advice](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/advisory/) from researchers about how we can make ready4 more relevant and useful.
