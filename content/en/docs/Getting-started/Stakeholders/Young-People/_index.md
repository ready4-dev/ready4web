  Young people can help ensure that ready4 remains [accountable](/docs/getting-started/motivation/) for addressing topics of importance to them.
---

Young people have an important role to play in both the development of the overarching ready4 model and the applicability of ready4 to specific decision problems.

One of the main contributions that young people can make is to [provide advice](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/advisory/). To date, the advice we have elicited from young people has related to shaping the design and conduct of individual modelling projects. The process we have previously used to engage young people in modelling projects normally begins with the advertisement for expressions of interest via a range of social media platforms (always including those maintained by [Orygen](https://www.orygen.org.au)). We plan to supplement these opportunities to shape individual project with opportunities to shape the overall development of the ready4 model though [growing a ready4 support community](/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/support/).
