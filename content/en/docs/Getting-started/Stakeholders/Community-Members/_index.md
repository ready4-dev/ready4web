  Community members can help ensure that ready4 remains [accountable](/docs/getting-started/motivation/) for addressing topics of importance to them.
---

Community members have an important role to play in both the development of the overarching ready4 model and the applicability of ready4 to specific decision problems.

One of the main contributions that community members can make is to [provide advice](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/advisory/). To date, the advice we have elicited from community members has related to shaping the design and conduct of individual modelling projects. In the medium term, he hope to supplement these opportunities through [growing a ready4 support community](/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/support/).
