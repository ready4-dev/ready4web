  Coders can use ready4 to enhance the impact and re-usability of their algorithms.
---

If you are a coder, you may be a data scientist or software engineer by training or are perhaps a quantitative researcher who spends a high proportion of their time writing code to undertake their work. 

## Role
The primary role of coders in ready4 [modelling projects](/docs/getting-started/concepts/project/) is to author [modules](/docs/getting-started/concepts/module/) that implement [computational models](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model/).

## Tools
The ready4 tools of most use to coders are the [software framework libraries](/docs/software/libraries/types/framework/) for [authoring modules](/docs/framework/use/authoring-modules/). 

## Benefits
ready4 provides an opportunity to write software that matters! Our aim is to help improve the lives of young people through [empowering decision makers with better models](/docs/getting-started/motivation/). If you already write code for youth mental health modelling projects, the ready4 software framework may help you enhance your impact (facilitating code re-use) and work-efficiency (through partial automation of code development and quality-assurance workflows). 

## Contributing to ready4
The types of [contribution](/docs/contribution-guidelines/) you can make to ready4 include:

- [testing, improving and authoring code](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/code/);
- [enhancing technical documentation and help](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/community/); and
- [providing advice and feedback](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/advisory/).
