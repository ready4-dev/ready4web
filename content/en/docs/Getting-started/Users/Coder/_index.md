  Coders can use ready4 to enhance the impact and re-usability of their algorithms.
---

If you are a coder, you may be a data scientist or software engineer by training or are perhaps a quantitative researcher who spends a high proportion of their time writing code to undertake their work. We hope that ready4 can be of benefit to your youth mental health modelling projects through a combination of enhanced impact (supporting modular approaches to computational models that facilitate re-use by others) and efficiency (through partial automation of code development and quality-assurance workflows). You may also wish to contribute to the development of the ready4 project by either testing and improving our existing software (including its documentation) or by writing new libraries of ready4 modules.
