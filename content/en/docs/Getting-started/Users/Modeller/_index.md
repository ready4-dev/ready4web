  Modellers can use ready4 to leverage the work of other modellers and to implement reproducible modelling analyses.
---

If you are a modeller, you are responsible for the overall implementation of a modelling project from initial conceptualisation through to analysis and reporting. You are likely to be an economist, epidemiologist or statistician and are probably reasonably comfortable with writing analysis scripts in statistical software (potentially including R), without necessarily being a coding wizard. We hope that ready4 can be of benefit to you by helping you to find, use and combine relevant existing model algorithms and datasets, to implement more reproducible workflows in your youth mental health modelling projects, and to share your results in formats that are more readily accessible by others. You could also contribute to the development of the ready4 project by collaborating with coders to develop new modules addressing important youth mental health modelling topics.
