  Modellers can use ready4 to leverage the work of other modellers and to implement [reproducible](/docs/getting-started/concepts/reproducible-replicable-generalisable/) modelling [analyses](/docs/analyses/).
---

If you are a modeller, you are responsible for the overall implementation of a modelling study from initial conceptualisation through to analysis and reporting. You are likely to be an economist, epidemiologist or statistician and are probably reasonably comfortable with writing analysis scripts in statistical software (potentially including R), without necessarily being a coding wizard. 

## Role
The primary role of modellers in ready4 [modelling projects](/docs/getting-started/concepts/project/) is to use [modules](/docs/getting-started/concepts/module/) to undertake analyse as part of [modelling projects](/docs/getting-started/concepts/project/).

## Benefits of using ready4
We hope that ready4 can be of benefit to you by helping you to efficiently [build on work by other modellers](/docs/model/using-modules/), to implement more reproducible workflows, and to [share your work](/docs/datasets/authoring-data/) so that it can be reused.  

## Contributing to ready4
The types of [contribution](/docs/contribution-guidelines/) you can make to ready4 include:

- [leading or participating in a modelling project](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/use/);
- [enhancing technical documentation and help](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/community/); and
- [providing advice and feedback](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/advisory/).
