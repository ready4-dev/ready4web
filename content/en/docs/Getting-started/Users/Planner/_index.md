  Planners can use ready4 [decision aids](/docs/model/analyses/decision-aids/) to generate useful insights.
---

If you are an planner, you contribute to policy development or service planning to help immprove the mental health of young people. You probably value the role of modelling to inform your work, but are likely to rely on others to provide much of the technical expertise to implement [computational models](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model/). 

## Role
The primary role of planners in ready4 [modelling projects](/docs/getting-started/concepts/project/) is co-design and use of models to support decision making.

## Tools
The ready4 tools of most use to planners are [user-interfaces](/docs/software/user-interfaces/) that convert computational models into useful [decision aids](/docs/model/analyses/decision-aids/). 

## Benefits of using ready4
We hope that ready4 can provide you with [transparent reusable and updatable](/docs/framework/standards/) decision support.

## Contributing to ready4
The types of [contribution](/docs/contribution-guidelines/) you can make to ready4 include:

- [leading or participating in a modelling project](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/use/);
- [providing advice and feedback](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/advisory/); and
- [funding a project](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/funding/).
