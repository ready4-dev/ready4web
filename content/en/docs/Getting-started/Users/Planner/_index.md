If you are an planner, you are likely to contribute to policy development or service planning, you value the role of modelling to inform your work, but are more likely to use models developed by others than to build your own. We hope that ready4 can be of benefit to you through providing user-interfaces that make it easier for less technically minded users to configure and run open source computational models in youth mental health.
