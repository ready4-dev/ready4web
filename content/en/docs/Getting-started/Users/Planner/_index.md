---

If you are an planner, you contribute to policy development or service planning to help immprove the mental health of young people. You probably value the role of modelling to inform your work, but are likely to rely on others to provide much of the technical expertise to implement [computational models](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model/). 

## Role
The primary role of planners in ready4 [modelling projects](/docs/getting-started/concepts/project/) is co-design of decision aids that provide [user-interfaces](/docs/getting-started/software/user-interfaces/) for allow easy configuration of models to run bespoke [analyses](/docs/analyses/).

## Benefits of using ready4
We hope that ready4 can provide you with [accountable, flexible and up to date](/docs/getting-started/motivation/) decision support.

## Contributing to ready4
The types of [contribution](/docs/contribution-guidelines/) you can make to ready4 include:

- [leading or participating in a modelling project](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/use/);
- [providing advice and feedback](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/advisory/); and
- [funding a project](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/funding/).
