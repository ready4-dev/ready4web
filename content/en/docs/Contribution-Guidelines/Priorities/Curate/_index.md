  We want all our future [production release](/docs/getting-started/software/status/production-releases/) software to be maintained and updated to identify and fix bugs, respond to changes in upstream [dependencies](/docs/getting-started/software/libraries/dependencies/), enhance functionality and usability and to conscientiously deprecate outdated code.

## Why?
A significant limitation of many health economic models is that they are not updated and b[ecome progressively less relevant to current decision-making](/docs/getting-started/motivation/). The importance of maintaining a [computational model](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model/) increases with its potential utility - as it becomes more widely used, its limitations (errors, bugs, restrictive functionality and confusing / inadequate documentation) are more likely to become exposed and to require remediation. Addressing such issues needs to implemented skillfully and considerately to avoid unintended consequences on existing model users (e.g. to ensure software edits to fix one problem do not prevent previously written [replication code](/docs/analyses/replication-code/) or downstream dependencies from executing correctly). [Open source](/docs/getting-started/software/terms/licenses/) projects also need to make changes in response to decisions by third parties - such as edits to upstream dependencies and changes in the policies of hosting [repositories](/docs/getting-started/software/repositories/) and to update citation / acknowledgement information to appropriately reflect new contributors.


## What?
The most important types of help we need with this priority area are [code contributions](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/code/), [community support](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/community/), [advice](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/advisory/) and [funding](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/funding/).

## How?
The main tasks for the curation of [ready4 software](/docs/getting-started/software/) are to:

1. Appropriately configure the settings of the [ready4 GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ready4-dev) and its constituent repositories to facilitate clear and efficient maintenance workflows.

2. *Proactively*:

- [author](/docs/model/authoring-modules/) ongoing improvements to software testing, [documentation](/docs/getting-started/software/libraries/documentation/) and functionality; 

- make [archived releases](/docs/getting-started/software/status/archived-releases/) of key development milestones in the [ready4 Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/ready4); and

- submit new production releases to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

3. *Reactively* elicit, review and address feedback and contributions from ready4 [community](/community/) (e.g. bugs, issues and feature-requests).

## When?
Curation is an ongoing and current responsibility. However, our curation obligations are expected to grow considerably over the 2023-2025 period as we [launch more production releases](/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/launch/), [extend the ready4 model](/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/extend/) and [grow the ready4 community](/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/support/).
