  We want all our future [production release](/docs/getting-started/software/status/production-releases/) software to be maintained and updated to identify and fix bugs, respond to changes in upstream [dependencies](/docs/getting-started/software/libraries/dependencies/), enhance functionality and usability and to conscientiously deprecate outdated code.
---


## Why?
A significant limitation of may health economic models is that they are not updated and become progressively less relevant to current decision-making. The importance of maintaining a [computational model](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model/) increases with its potential utility - as it becomes more widely used, its limitations (errors, bugs, restrictive functionality and confusing / inadequate documentation) are more likely to become exposed and to require remediation. Addressing such issues needs to implemented skillfully and considerately to avoid unintended consequences on existing model users (e.g. to ensure software edits to fix one problem do not prevent previously written [replication code](/docs/analyses/replication-code/) or downstream dependencies from executing correctly). [Open source](docs/getting-started/software/terms/licenses/) projects also need to make changes in response to decisions by third parties - such as edits to upstream dependencies and changes in the policies of hosting [repositories](/docs/getting-started/software/repositories/) and to update citation / acknowledgement information to appropriately reflect new contributors.


## What?
The most important types of help we need with this priority area are [code contributions](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/code/), [community support](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/community/), [advice](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/advisory/) and [funding](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/funding/).

## How?
The main tasks for the curation of [ready4 software](/docs/getting-started/software/) are:

1. Appropriately configure the settings of the [ready4 GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ready4-dev) and its constituent repositories to facilitate clear and efficient workflows.

2. *Proactively*:

- implement ongoing improvements to software testing, documentation and functionality; 

- make [archived releases](/docs/getting-started/software/status/archived-releases/) of development milestones in the [ready4 Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/ready4); and

- submit new production releases to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

3. *Reactively* review and address feedback and contributions from ready4 community (e.g. bugs, issues and feature-requests).

## When?
Each new production release is a trigger for expanded curation obligations.
