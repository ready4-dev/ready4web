  ready4 needs the guidance of young people, decision-makers and technical experts to shape its development.
---

## What?
We need advice:

- to help review and update our [priority goals](/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/) and develop, refine and implement strategies for achieving these goals;

- to help plan and execute [modelling projects](docs/getting-started/concepts/project/) that produce [transparent, reusable and updatable](/docs/framework/standards/) computational models; and

- to identify how our existing [software](/docs/software/) and [data](/docs/model/datasets/finding-data/) can be usefully improved.

## Who?
We wan advice from our [users](/docs/getting-started/users/) ([coders](/docs/getting-started/users/coder/), [modellers](/docs/getting-started/users/modeller/) and [planners](/docs/getting-started/users/planner/)), [stakeholders](/docs/getting-started/stakeholders/) ([funders](/docs/getting-started/stakeholders/funders/), [researchers](/docs/getting-started/stakeholders/researchers/) and [young people](/docs/getting-started/stakeholders/young-people/)) and other supporters (those with relevant expertise in technical communication, building open source communities, product development, etc).

## How?
Advice can be provided by:

1. Joining a volunteer advisory board to help shape the evolution of ready4. We plan on inviting expressions of interest (EOIs) for this type of role later in 2023. If you want to ensure that you are sent details of the EOI invitations, [contact the ready4 project lead](https://mph-economist.netlify.app/#contact).

2. Participate in the advisory structures and events of individual [modelling projects](/docs/getting-started/concepts/project/). The nature of these opportunities will vary by project and the team responsible for implementing each project. For those projects we lead ourselves, we typically promote such EOIs via the [Orygen website](https://www.orygen.org.au) and associated social media channels.

3. Flag software features, usability and documentation issues. If you have the capacity and willingness to also fix the issues you can approach this using the process for [making a code contribution](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/code/). Otherwise, you can do so by creating an issue on that software projects repository in our [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ready4-dev). For example, to create a new issue relating to the [ready4 foundation library](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4/), use https://github.com/ready4-dev/ready4/issues/new (you will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account).
