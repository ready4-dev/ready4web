## What?
Help other members of the ready4 [community](/community/) to apply ready4 by authoring documentation, developing training and posting answers in online help. This support is essential for us to advance the following project goals:

2\. [Maintaining ready4](/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/curate/).

4\. [Growing a ready4 community](/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/support/).

5\. [Extending ready4](/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/extend/).


## Who?
Any community member ([user](/docs/getting-started/users/) or other [stakeholders](/docs/getting-started/stakeholders/)) can help us to improve the accessibility, clarity and usefulness of our documentation. [Coders](/docs/getting-started/users/coder/) and [modellers](/docs/getting-started/users/modeller/) are particularly welcome to contribute support that leverages their technical expertise.

## How?
The types of support that we welcome contributions on include:

1. Improving the documentation contained on this website. To do this, you will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Once you have that, you can:

- flag a general issue and suggest improvements by clicking on the "Create documentation issue" link or visiting https://github.com/ready4-dev/ready4web/labels/documentation ; and/or

- suggest edits to a specific page by clicking on the "Edit this page" link.

2. Improve the documentation for specific library, executable or dataset. We have yet to set up a streamlined workflow for this process, so for moment please contact the project lead directly if you ar interested in making this type of contribution.

3. Contributing to developing other training and support resources (e.g. answering questions in online help, video turorials, etc). We believe that this type of content is most likely to become relevant when we have made more progress in developing the ready4 community. But again, if you are interested in this area, please contact the project lead to discuss.
