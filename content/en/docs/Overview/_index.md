  How ready4 aims to improve the transferability of health economic models.
---

## What is ready4?
ready4 is a prototype software framework for implementing [replicable](/docs/getting-started/concepts/reproducible-replicable-generalisable/) and [transferable](/docs/getting-started/concepts/transferable/) health economic models. The project is implemented in the [open source](/docs/software/terms/licenses/) language R and is led by [researchers at Monash University](/about/). 

## What is a software framework?
A [software framework](/docs/framework/) is a shared technology that can be used by multiple teams to collaboratively author [software](/docs/software). 

## What is a computational model?
A [computational model](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model) is a simplified representation of a system of interest that is implemented in computer code.

## What makes a ready4 model modular?
The [paradigms we use](/docs/framework/implementation/paradigm/) for computational model development allow individual model components ([modules](/docs/framework/implementation/modularity/)) to be independently [reused](/docs/model/modules/using-modules/) (in other models) and safely and flexibly [combined](/docs/framework/implementation/paradigm/object-oriented/#modular-computational-models) (to model more extensive systems).

## Why is that useful?
We hope that ready4 will help [address significant limitations](/docs/getting-started/motivation/) in how health economic models are implemented, encourage [data sharing](/docs/model/datasets) and facilitate [modelling analyses](/docs/model/analyses) that [generate valuable insights](/docs/examples) for health policymakers and system planners.

## Who is it for?
ready4 is designed to be primarily used by [coders](/docs/getting-started/users/coder) and [modellers](/docs/getting-started/users/modeller) working collaboratively on [computational modelling projects](/docs/getting-started/concepts/project/) in which other stakeholders such as [funders](/docs/getting-started/stakeholders/funders/) and [researchers](/docs/getting-started/stakeholders/researchers/) make essential contributions. 

## What is it being used for?
Currently, ready4 is being applied to develop and apply [a modular model of youth mental health](https://readyforwhatsnext.org/).

## Can I use it?
ready4 is publicly available and free for you to assess (to verify and validate), apply (to use and/or author health economic model modules) and to derive your own derivative works from (to leverage and enhance the work of others) [under liberal terms of use](/docs/software/terms/).

## Why is it a prototype?
Currently the ready4 software suite is only available in the form of [development releases](/docs/software/status/development-releases/). That means ready4 may require more development, documentation and testing before it could be confidently used for scientific purposes other than the specific studies to which the ready4 development team have already applied it.


## Why is it called ready4?
ready4 is short-hand for "readyforwhatsnext", the title of [the research project that catalysed the framework](/about/) and a reference to how computational models can improve the preparedness of decision makers and system planners.

## Where should I go next?
We'd recommend reading the documentation in the order in which sections appear in the table of contents (so go next to [Examples](/docs/examples/), then to [Getting started](/docs/getting-started/) and so on). Scientific manuscripts on the framework's [ethical underpinnings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17798.pdf) and [early implementation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14138.pdf) are also available.
