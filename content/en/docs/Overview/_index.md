  How ready4 aims to improve policy and system planning in youth mental health.
---

## What is ready4?
ready4 is a [modular](/docs/getting-started/concepts/module/) computational model of the systems that shape young people's mental health that is being developed as [an open source project](/docs/getting-started/software/terms/licenses/) led by [researchers at Orygen and Monash University](/about/). 

## What is a computational model?
A [computational model](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model) is a simplified representation of a system of interest that is implemented in computer code.

## What makes it modular?
The approach we are taking to computational model development means that individual model components ([modules](/docs/framework/implementation/modularity/)) can be independently [reused](/docs/model/using-modules/) (in other models) and be safely and flexibly [combined](/docs/framework/implementation/paradigm//#modular-computational-models) (to model more extensive systems).

## How is that achieved?
To facilitate interoperability between modules developed by multiple modelling teams, we have defined a [framework](/docs/framework/) for model development that comprises a set of explicit [standards](/docs/framework/standards) and the [software](/docs/getting-started/software) (in our case, written in R) to implement modules that adhere to those standards.

## Why is that useful?
Modelling youth mental health systems is a complex task - that means it is easy to make mistakes and is more likely to be done well if approached [collaboratively, transparently and iteratively](/docs/getting-started/motivation/). We hope that ready4 will support these approaches and in so doing help to [share data](/docs/datasets), improve the reproducibility of [modelling analyses](/docs/analyses) and [generate valuable insights](/docs/examples) for youth mental health policymakers and system planners.

## Can I use it?
ready4 is designed to be primarily used by [coders](/docs/getting-started/users/coder), [modellers](/docs/getting-started/users/modeller) and [planners](/docs/getting-started/users/planner), working collaboratively on [computational modelling projects](/docs/getting-started/concepts/project/) with each other and with other stakeholders such as funders, researchers and young people. ready4 is free for you to assess (to verify and validate), apply (to generate novel insights into decision problems of interest to you) and to derive your own derivative works from (to leverage and enhance the work of others) [under liberal licensing arrangements](/docs/getting-started/software/terms/).

## Can I help?
ready4 is a collaborative project and we'd love your help in progressing our [priorty project goals](/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/)! You can [contribute code improvements](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/code/), enhance our [documentation and community support](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/community/), [use ready4](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/use/), give us [advice](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/advisory/) and help [fund our development](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/funding/).

## Why is it called ready4?
ready4 is shorthand for "readyforwhatsnext", the title of [the research project that catalysed this model](/about/) and a reference to both how good mental health can equip young people for better lives and how computational models can improve the preparedness of decision makers and system planners.

## Where should I go next?
We'd recommend reading the documentation in the order in which sections appear in the table of contents (so go next to [Examples](/docs/examples/), then to [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) and so on).
