description: >
  The ready4 framework identifies a set of standards to which the ready4 [model](/docs/model/), its [datasets](/docs/datasets/) and [analyses](/docs/analyses/) are expected to adhere.
---

An essential component of the ready4 framework is standardisation. Defining and adhering to a common set of standards is important because:

- explicit, measurable standards are good modelling practice;

- to implement [a modular computational model](/docs/getting-started/concepts/module/), ready4 model modules need to be interoperable (ie [they can easily and safely be combined](/docs/framework/implementation/paradigm/object-oriented/#modular-computational-models));

- as an open source project with multiple [users](/docs/getting-started/users/) and [contributors](/docs/contribution-guidelines/), consistency in implementation and documentation facilitates collaboration and ease of use;

- standardised workflows are easier to partially automate.

We have therefore developed a set of standards that we believe support good practice in the development of open source [computational models](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model). We are describing these standards, their rationale and how ready4 implements them, in a manuscript being prepared for publication. When it is publicly available we will provide a link in an updated version of this page.
