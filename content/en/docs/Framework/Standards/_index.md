  The ready4 software framework has been designed to implement [computational models](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model/) that meet explicit standards of transparency, reusability and updatability.
---

A key motivation for the ready4 software framework is standardisation. Defining and adhering to a common set of standards is important because:

- explicit, measurable standards are good modelling practice;

- to implement [a modular computational model](/docs/getting-started/concepts/module/), ready4 model modules need to be interoperable (ie [they can easily and safely be combined](/docs/framework/implementation/paradigm/object-oriented/#modular-computational-models));

- as an open source project with multiple [users](/docs/getting-started/users/) and [contributors](/docs/contribution-guidelines/), consistency in implementation and documentation facilitates collaboration and ease of use;

- standardised workflows are easier to partially automate.

The ready4 software framework supports implementations of [computational models](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model) that are transparent, reusable and updatable.

## Transparent
Model code and data are publicly available in online [code repositories](/docs/software/repositories/) and [data collections](/docs/model/datasets/finding-data/search/). Algorithms are [documented and transparently and regularly tested](/docs/software/libraries/documentation/). Model development occurs [in the open](https://github.com/ready4-dev) and [invites community participation](/community/), with each individual's [contribution](/docs/contribution-guidelines/) publicly identifiable. [Analyses](/docs/model/analyses/) are [reproducible and replicable](/docs/getting-started/concepts/reproducible-replicable-generalisable/#reproduction-and-replication).

## Reusable
[Model modules](/docs/model/) and [datasets](/docs/model/datasets/) originally developed in one modelling project can be independently [reused](/docs/model/modules/using-modules/) in other projects. As they share a common [framework](/docs/framework/), model modules can be combined in other models and analyses to address [multiple topics](/docs/examples/). Due to ready4's [code implementation paradigms](/docs/framework/implementation/paradigm/), model modules are easier to [transfer](/docs/getting-started/concepts/transferable/) for use in other decision contexts.

## Updatable
Model code, data and analyses are versioned, with an ongoing program of making [new and updated releases](/blog/releases/). Software is [maintained](/docs/contribution-guidelines/priorities/curate/), with opportunities for users and contributors to flag issues, request features and supply [code contributions](/docs/contribution-guidelines/contribution-types/code/).

Our criteria for assessing transparent, reusable and updatable implementation of computational models are described in a manuscript being prepared for publication.
