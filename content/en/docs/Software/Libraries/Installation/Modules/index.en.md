## Before you install

If you plan on using existing ready4 modules for a modelling project, you can review [currently available module libraries](/docs/software/libraries/types/module/), to identify which libraries are relevant to your project.

**However, please note that no ready4 module library is yet available as a \[production release\](/docs/software/status/production-releases/. You should therefore understand the limitations of using ready4 software [development releases](/docs/software/status/development-releases/) before you make the decision to install this software.**

## Installation

The command to install each ready4 module takes the following format.

<div class="highlight">

<pre class='chroma'><code class='language-r' data-lang='r'><span><span class='nf'>devtools</span><span class='nf'>::</span><span class='nf'><a href='https://remotes.r-lib.org/reference/install_github.html'>install_github</a></span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>"ready4-dev/PACKAGE_NAME"</span><span class='o'>)</span></span></code></pre>

</div>

For example, if you are planning to predict health utility using some of the mapping algorithms that we have previously developed, you can install the [youthu](https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthu/) library with the following command.

<div class="highlight">

<pre class='chroma'><code class='language-r' data-lang='r'><span><span class='nf'>devtools</span><span class='nf'>::</span><span class='nf'><a href='https://remotes.r-lib.org/reference/install_github.html'>install_github</a></span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>"ready4-dev/youthu"</span><span class='o'>)</span></span></code></pre>

</div>

## Configuration

A small number of ready4 modules require that you configure some of the [dependencies](/docs/software/libraries/dependencies/) installed with them before they can be used. In particular:

-   if you are using modules from the [TTU](https://ready4-dev.github.io/TTU/) package to undertake a utility mapping study, you will need to have both installed and configured the cmdstanr R package as per the instructions on [that package's documentation website](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/); and

-   if you are using the [mychoice](https://ready4-dev.github.io/mychoice/) package to undertake a discrete choice experiment study and are using a Mac, you need to ensure that you have a Fortran compiler installed. Some relevant advice on this: <https://mac.r-project.org/tools/> .

## Try it out!

Before you apply ready4 modules to your own project, you should make sure you can run some or all of the example code included in relevant library vignette articles. The package website URL takes the form of `https://ready4-dev.github.io/PACKAGE_NAME/articles/` (e.g.Â the vignettes for the youthvars package are available at <https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthvars/articles/>).
