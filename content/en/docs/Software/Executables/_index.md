  Executables (programs and sub-routines) are used to apply computational models to data and to report the resulting analyses.

Currently all ready4 programs and subroutines are written in R Markdown. Each ready4 program and subroutine depends on at least one [ready4 framework library](../libraries/types/framework/) as well as one or more [ready4 module libraries](../libraries/types/module/). The required libraries will vary based on the purpose of the program. ready4 programs and subroutines typically generate reporting documents in file formats such as PDF, Word and HTML.
