  Production releases are the versions of software intended for end-users.

Production releases of our code are intended for end-users and signal that they have undergone a number of quality assurance checks and have some supporting documentation. 

Production releases of ready4 R packages will be submitted to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Unless and until a software item is submitted to a production code repository like CRAN, the recommended platform from which to install our software is that software's GitHub repository.

**Currently only [one ready library is available on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ready4/index.html)**.
