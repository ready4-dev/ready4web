Work is underway to develop ready4 modules for modelling the affordability and cost-effectiveness of youth mental health programs. A very early [development release](/docs/getting-started/software/status/development-releases/) of [bimp](https://ready4-dev.github.io/bimp/index.html) - a [library](/docs/getting-started/software/libraries/) for undertaking budget impact analysis, is currently available. However, as bimp is unvalidated and highly preliminary (e.g. not yet implemented as ready4 [modules](/docs/getting-started/concepts/module/)), it is not yet listed in the summary table of ready4 [model module libraries](/docs/getting-started/software/libraries/types/module/). The pace of future development of bimp and new modules for efficiently deploying existing open source economic evaluation tools within the ready4 framework will depend on how we [mobilise support](/docs/contribution-guidelines/) from a nascent ready4 [community](/community/).
