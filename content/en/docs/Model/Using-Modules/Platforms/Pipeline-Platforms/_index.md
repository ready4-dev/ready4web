Work is underway to develop ready4 [modules](/docs/getting-started/concepts/module/) for modelling youth mental health service platforms. All of this work currently exists as [unreleased code](/docs/getting-started/software/status/unreleased/) for implementing:

- a discrete event simulation of primary mental health services for young people; 
- a simple cohort model of early psychosis services; and
- a blended (systems dynamics / discrete event simulation) model for optimising eligibility and referral policies across multiple services. 

The first two of the above models are currently implemented in R and are sufficiently advanced to produce exploratory analysis. However, neither are adequately documented or tested and need to be redeveloped as ready4 model modules and re-validated prior to [development releases](/docs/getting-started/software/status/development-releases/).  The optimisation model was implemented in Java and was populated with toy data - this will require more substantial development prior to public release
