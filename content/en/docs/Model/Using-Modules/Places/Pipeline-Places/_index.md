Work is underway to add to develop ready4 modules for modelling places. All of this work currently exists as [unreleased code](/docs/getting-started/software/status/unreleased/), although a (currently deprecated) app abuild using this unreleased code is [publicly available](/docs/analyses/decision-aids/springtides-app/). The same code was also used to [generate analysis during the early phase of the COVUID-19 pandemic](/blog/2021/02/18/modelling-the-mental-health-impacts-of-covid-19/). This code is principally focused on:

- synthesising geometry and spatial attribute data; 

- simulating changes in spatial attribute count data (e.g. area resident populations); and

- predicting prevalence and incidence by area.

Initial [development releases](/docs/getting-started/software/status/development-releases/) of places module libraries, along with an updated app, are anticipated in the second half of 2023.
