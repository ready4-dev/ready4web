Work is underway to add to develop additional ready4 modules for modelling people. All of this work currently exists as [unreleased code](/docs/getting-started/software/status/unreleased/). The pipeline of projects is as follows:

- modules for creating synthetic household datasets from multiple longitudinal datasets of varying structure, including modules specifically designed to streamline wrangling data from the HILDA and LSAC datasets (both from Australia); and

- modules to implement agent based model simulations.

A significant amount of work has already been completed on both projects and initial [development releases](/docs/getting-started/software/status/development-releases/) of each, along with one scientific manuscript, are anticipated in the second half of 2023.
