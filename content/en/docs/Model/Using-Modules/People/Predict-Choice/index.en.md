The tools in mychoice are designed to make it easier to develop and use choice models with [ready4 - an open source health economic model of the systems shaping mental health and wellbeing in young people](https://www.ready4-dev.com).

This development version of the mychoice package has been made available as part of the process of testing and documenting the package.

Currently there are no vignettes available. However, examples of the application of mychoice functions to a real world discrete choice experiment are in programs available at <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6626256> (design of a discrete choice experiment survey) and <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7223286> (analysis of discrete choice experiment survey responses). PDF versions of each program, along with the artefacts produced by each are available in the online dataset at <https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VGPIPS>.
