  A ready4 [computational model](/docs/getting-started/concepts/model/) is implemented as a set of [modules](/docs/getting-started/concepts/module/), all of which are authored with the ready4 [software framework](/docs/framework/). These modules can be re-used and combined to create other computational models.
