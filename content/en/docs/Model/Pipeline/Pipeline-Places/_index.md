Our current pipeline of modules for modelling places is principally focused on:

- synthesising geometry and spatial attribute data; 

- simulating changes in spatial attribute count data (e.g. area resident populations); and

- predicting prevalence and incidence by area.

Although all of the source code is currently unreleased, a (currently deprecated) [app built using this code](/docs/analyses/decision-aids/springtides-app/) is publicly available. The same code was also used to [generate analysis during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic](/blog/2021/02/18/modelling-the-mental-health-impacts-of-covid-19/). Initial [development releases](/docs/getting-started/software/status/development-releases/) of places module [libraries](/docs/getting-started/software/libraries/), along with an updated app, are anticipated in the second half of 2023.
