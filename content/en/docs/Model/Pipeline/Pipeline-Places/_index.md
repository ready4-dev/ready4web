Our current pipeline of modules for modelling places is principally focused on producing libraries to:

- synthesise geometry and spatial attribute data; 

- simulate changes in spatial attribute count data (e.g. area resident populations); 

- predict prevalence and incidence by area; and

- provide a user-interface (i.e. software to implement an updated version of the currently deprecated [Springtides app](/docs/analyses/decision-aids/springtides-app/)).

Although unreleased, the source code for the above projects has been used to [generate analysis during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic](/blog/2021/02/18/modelling-the-mental-health-impacts-of-covid-19/). Initial [development releases](/docs/getting-started/software/status/development-releases/) of places module [libraries](/docs/getting-started/software/libraries/), along with an updated app, are anticipated in the second half of 2023.
