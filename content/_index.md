# Additional Information

The Health Sciences Journal Theme allows you to build a static copy of a journal run using [Open Journal Systems](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/). This may be used to build a static mirror or to separate the front end from the submissions back end.

It is primarily intended for organisations running peer-reviewed academic journals, but can be used for any serial publication.
