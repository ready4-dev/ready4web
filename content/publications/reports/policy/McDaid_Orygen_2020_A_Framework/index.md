## Summary

The mental capital of the world’s young people is essential to global economic development. However, formation of this essential resource is jeopardised by the high prevalence and costly impacts of mental disorders, which predominantly emerge early in life. To reduce the impact of these disorders on mental capital formation, we recommend tackling the social determinants of mental disorders, enhancing youth mental health services and improving social supports for young people with mental health problems.

Barriers to achieving these objectives exist in low, middle and high-income country contexts in the form of resource constraints, an incomplete evidence base and the complexity of systems that require reform. However, these challenges can be overcome through a combination of scaling up investment in youth mental health programmes that have proven to be cost effective; building the capabilities of youth mental health advocates; embedding structural supports for system development, including collaboration across many sectors of the economy; and broadening the scope and breadth of economic research in youth mental health.
