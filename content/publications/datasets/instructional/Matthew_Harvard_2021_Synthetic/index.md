An [instructional dataset](../) of illustrative input data for use with the `Ready4useDyad` [ready4 framework](../../../../framework/) [module](../../../../project/a_ready4-project/modules/) from the [ready4use R package](../../../../tags/ready4use-r-package/). The inputs are fake samples of young people with mental health and [AQoL-6D](../../../../tags/aqol-6d/) or [EQ-5D](../../../../tags/eq-5d/) measures and data-dictionaries to describe these samples. The dataset was originally developed to help illustrate methods developed for a [utility mapping](../../../../tags/utility-mapping/) study and can be used for more general purposes as part of the [Spring To Life model of people](../../../../project/c_springtolife-project/).
