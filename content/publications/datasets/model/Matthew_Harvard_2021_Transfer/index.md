A [model dataset](../) of [AQoL-6D](../../../../tags/aqol-6d/) [utility mapping](../../../../tags/utility-mapping/) models that are the [outputs](../../../../categories/datasets-models-outputs) of supplying data from a clinical sample of [Australian](../../../../tags/australia) young people as inputs to a [computer program](../../../../publications/programs/hamilton_zenodo_2022_complete/) that implements [a mapping study](../../../../publications/reports/scientific/hamilton_medrxiv_2021_predicting/). 

The models in this dataset are intended to be used as [inputs](../../../../categories/datasets-models-inputs) to [ready4 framework](../../../../framework/) [modules](../../../../project/a_ready4-project/modules/) from the [youthu R package](../../../../tags/youthu-r-package/) to predict AQoL-6D in clinical youth mental health samples as part of the [Spring To Life model of people](../../../../project/c_springtolife-project/).
