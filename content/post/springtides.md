title: Springtides - a spatial simulation of the epidemiology of mental disorder.
---

Springtides is a spatial epidemiology model that predicts the prevalence of a range of mental health and substance disorders for user defined regions of Australia. The Springtides model extends the spatial simulation component of the [readyforwhatsnext](../readyforwhatsnext/) model. One of its first applications was to project the [potential mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the absence of government intervention.](https://www.orygen.org.au/About/News-And-Events/2020/Modelling-predicts-an-additional-82,000-young-Vict)

Project code-libraries and datasets will be publicly released later in 2021.
