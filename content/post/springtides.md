title: Springtides - a spatial simulation of the epidemiology of mental disorder.
---

Springtides is a spatial epidemiology model that predicts the prevalence of a range of mental health and substance disorders for user defined regions of Australia. The Springtides model extends the spatial simulation component of the [readyforwhatsnext](../../readyforwhatsnext/) model. Project code-libraries and datasets will be publicly released later in 2021 but some [initial model outputs have been made public](../insights_springtides/).
