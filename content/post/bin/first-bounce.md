title: First Bounce - modelling primary mental health care for young people.
---

First Bounce is an in-development model of primary mental health services for young people. The project is funded by two partnership grants - one concluded, one commencing - that are funded by Orygen, headspace National and Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council. To date the project has focused primarily on modelling [transfer to utility](../../tags/transfer-to-utility) in young people presenting to primary mental health services.

First Bounce model outputs including [insights](../../categories/first-bounce-insight/), [toolkits](../../categories/first-bounce-toolkits) and [datasets](../../categories/first-bounce-datasets) are currently available.
