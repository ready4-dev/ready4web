title: Predicting Quality Adjusted Life Years in young people attending primary mental health services
---

We applied our [youthvars](../youthvars-vignettes-ds/) and [TTU](../ttu-vignettes-ds/) toolkits to developing a dataset of transfer to utility models that predict adolescent weighted AQoL-6D health utility from a range of psychological distress, depression, anxiety and functioning predictors. [Vignettes from our youthu toolkit](../youthu-vignettes-ds/) illustrate (using fake data) how these models can be used to derive Quality Adjusted Life Year predictions. A preprint describing this study is now available at: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.07.21260129.
