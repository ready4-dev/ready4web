title: Predicting Quality Adjusted Life Years in young people attending primary mental health services
---

We applied our [youthvars](../youthvars-vignettes-ds/) and [TTU](../ttu-vignettes-ds/) toolkits to developing a [dataset of transfer to utility models](../youthu-ds-aqol6d) that predict adolescent weighted AQoL-6D health utility from a range of psychological distress, depression, anxiety and functioning predictors. [Vignettes from our youthu toolkit](../youthu-vignettes-ds/) illustrate (using fake data) how these models can be used to derive Quality Adjusted Life Year predictions. A preprint describing this study is now available at: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.07.21260129. The three toolkits, the dataset and the preprint are outputs of the [First Bounce model](../first-bounce/).
