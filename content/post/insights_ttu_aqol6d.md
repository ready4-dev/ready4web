title: Predicting Quality Adjusted Life Years in young people attending primary mental health services
---

We applied our [youthvars](../../publications/libraries/hamilton_zenodo_2022_youthvars_/) and [TTU](../../publications/libraries/gao_zenodo_2022_ttu_/) libraries to developing a [dataset of transfer to utility models](../../publications/datasets/model/matthew_harvard_2021_transfer/) that predict adolescent weighted AQoL-6D health utility from a range of psychological distress, depression, anxiety and functioning predictors. Vignettes from our [youthu R package](../../publications/libraries/hamilton_zenodo_2022_youthu_/) illustrate (using fake data) how these models can be used to derive Quality Adjusted Life Year predictions. A preprint describing this study is now available at: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.07.21260129. The three toolkits, the dataset and the preprint are outputs of the [Spring To Life model of people](../../project/c_springtolife-project/).
