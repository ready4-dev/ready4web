title: Preview of Youth Outcomes to Health Utility prediction toolkit
---

The development version of the [youthu Adolescent AQoL-6D prediction toolkit](https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthu/index.html) now includes a number of vignettes that highlight some of its main potential applications. Of particular note are the tools for [economic analysis](https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthu/articles/Economic_Analysis.html). Please note, that the current youthu package is for demonstration purposes only as it uses placeholder predictive models. The correct models will be uploaded to our [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ready4) on submission of the scientific manuscript that describes the development of the youthu package.
