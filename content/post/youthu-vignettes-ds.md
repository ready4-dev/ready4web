The development version of the [youthu toolkit](https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthu/index.html) now includes a number of vignettes that highlight some of its main potential applications. Of particular note are the tools to [predict Quality Adjusted Life Years](https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthu/articles/Prediction_With_Mdls.html) using transfer to utility models developed with the [TTU toolkit](https://ready4-dev.github.io/TTU/index.html) and hosted in our [TTU Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/TTU).

Note, this article updates a previous version from February 2021.
