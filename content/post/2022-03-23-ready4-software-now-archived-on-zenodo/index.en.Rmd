**The [software](../../../publications_ov/software/) that we create to implement the [ready4 framework](../../../framework/) and the models developed with that framework will from this point forward be archived on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).**

Zenodo is an open science platform developed by CERN and using it as a repository for archiving our software has a number of advantages:

- it creates a permanent copy of each software item, thus making these items appropriate for citation in peer-reviewed journal articles (unlike software stored in impermanent development code repositories such as [GitHub](https://github.com));
- it create DOI identifiers for each archived software item, minting a new DOI for each version of a software item sent for archiving as well as providing a catch all DOI that can apply to all versions of the software;
- it provides a simple workflow to integrate with GitHub repositories (where our most up to date development code is stored);
- it automatically submites archived items for indexing on [OpenAire](https://explore.openaire.eu/); and
- it includes easy to use citation tools to help generate appropriate citations for software in multiple output formats.

We have established a [ready4 community](https://zenodo.org/communities/ready4) within Zenodo, in which all our code is stored.
