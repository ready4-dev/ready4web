Some of the main uses of the ready4 [authoring toolkits](../../tags/authoring-toolkits) relate to automating a number of code authoring and documentation tasks. The approach we have taken to achieving this goal is to standardise naming conventions for aspects of our code base and to make frequent use of look-up tables. We've recently updated the workflow involved in these tasks and as a result the latest version of the abbreviations and look-up tables that describe naming conventions and class prototypes is available at [https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/2Y9VF9](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/2Y9VF9).
