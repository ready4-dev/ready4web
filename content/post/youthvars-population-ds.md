title: Youthvars synthetic dataset now available
---

The development version of the [youthvars variable classes and scoring toolkit](https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthvars/index.html) includes a synthetic agent population derived from the original study dataset. Details of how to access the replication dataset are described in [this vignette](https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthvars/articles/Replication_DS.html).

Note, an earlier version of this dataset was previously available as part of the [TTU transfer to utility toolkit](https://ready4-dev.github.io/TTU/index.html). That version has been superceded by the dataset in youthvars.
