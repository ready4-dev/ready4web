title: Algorithm generated documentation now available for ready4class function authoring toolkit.
---

ready4class provides a set of tools to standardise and automate a number of workflows for authoring and documenting the classes included in R code-libraries. Classes are descriptions of the data-structures used in a code-library and are useful for [assuring data-integrity](https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthu/articles/Data_Integrity.html) and for facilitating the generalising of model algorithms. The development version of the ready4class class authoring toolkit now includes [algorithm generated documentation](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4class/). That means the main functions have bare bones documentation available, but no vignettes have yet been written to demonstrate the practical applications of the toolkit. However, it is still possible to find real-world use examples of the ready4class functions, by viewing the DATASET.R file (in the data-raw directory of each package's source code) in any of the ready4 code libraries that we have authored. For example, how we used ready4class functions to help author and document the ready4use code-library can be seen [here](https://github.com/ready4-dev/ready4use/blob/master/data-raw/DATASET.R). ready4class is an output of the [readyforwhatsnext](../readyforwhatsnext/) project.
