title: Algorithm generated documentation now available for ready4use data authoring toolkit.
---

ready4use provides a set of tools to standardise and automate a number of workflows for authoring and documenting datasets included or used in conjunction with R code-libraries.  The development version of the ready4use dataset authoring toolkit now includes [algorithm generated documentation](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4use/). That means the main functions have bare bones documentation (automatically generated by the [ready4fun R package](../../publications/libraries/hamilton_zenodo_2021_ready4fun_/)), but no vignettes have yet been written to demonstrate the practical applications of the toolkit. However, it is still possible to find real-world use examples of the ready4use functions in the source code of a number of other ready4 code libraries that we have authored. For example, one group of functions in the ready4use package provide convenience wrappers to functions from the dataverse package that upload and download data from Dataverse online data repositories. 

Note: This article was ammended on 22nd March 2022 to remove a reference to a deprecated function.
