The development version of the [TTU transfer to utility modelling toolkit](https://ready4-dev.github.io/TTU/index.html) includes a synthetic agent population derived from the original source dataset. Details of how to access the replication dataset are described in [this vignette](https://ready4-dev.github.io/TTU/articles/Replication_DS.html).
