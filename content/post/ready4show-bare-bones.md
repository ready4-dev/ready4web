title: Algorithm generated documentation now available for ready4show data authoring toolkit.
---

ready4show provides a set of tools to standardise and automate a number of workflows for authoring and documenting report templates that are included or used in conjunction with R code-libraries.  The development version of the ready4show dataset authoring toolkit now includes [algorithm generated documentation](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4show/). That means the main functions have bare bones documentation (automatically generated by the [ready4fun R package](../../publications/libraries/hamilton_zenodo_2021_ready4fun_/)), but no vignettes have yet been written to demonstrate the practical applications of the package. However, it is still possible to find real-world use examples of the ready4show functions in the vignettes of a number of other ready4 code libraries that we have authored. For example, one function in the ready4show package - print_table - renders tables suitable for HTML, Word and PDF outputs.
