title: Repository of models for predicting AQoL-6D health utility now available.
---

To first set of models derived from real data that can be used in conjunction with the [youthu toolkit](https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthu/index.html) to predict Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) is now available at [https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DKDIB0](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DKDIB0). More information about these models and the study that generated them is [available here](../insights_ttu_aqol6d).
