title: Data repository with placeholder models for predicting AQoL-6D health utility now available
---

To help demonstrate the practical applications of the [youthu toolkit](https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthu/index.html), a number of placeholder models have been added to an online data repository, available at [https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JC6PTV](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JC6PTV). Please note, these models are intended for demonstration purposes only as they have been estimated from [synthetic data](../youthvars-population-ds/). 

July 14th 2021 Update: 
The corresponding models estimated from real data are [now available](../youthu-ds-aqol6d/).
