title: Algorithm generated documentation now available for bimp budget impact modelling toolkit.
---

The development version of the [bimp budget impact modelling toolkit](https://ready4-dev.github.io/bimp/) now includes algorithm generated documentation. That means the main functions have bare bones documentation available, but no vignettes have yet been written to demonstrate the practical applications of the toolkit.
