title: Algorithm generated documentation now available for bimp budget impact modelling toolkit.
---

The development version of the bimp budget impact modelling toolkit now includes algorithm generated [documentation](https://ready4-dev.github.io/bimp/). That means the main functions have bare bones documentation (automatically generated by the [ready4fun toolkit](../ready4fun-bare-bones/)), but no vignettes have yet been written to demonstrate the practical applications of the toolkit.
