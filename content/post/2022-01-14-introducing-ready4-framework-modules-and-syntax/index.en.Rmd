**The [ready4 framework](../../../framework/) has reached a major milestone with the launch of tools to implement modular models that use a simple and consistent syntax.**

Development version [software](../../../publications_ov/software/) to implement and extend the ready4 framework has been publicly available for over a year now. However, the way that this code was limited has limited its potential utility as a toolkit for developing transparent and modular mental health systems models. The latest release of the ready4 R package addresses these limitations with two important innovations:

- introducing the concept of [modules](../../../project/a_ready4-project/modules/), to facilitate consistent application of an [Object Oriented Programming](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4/articles/V_03.html) approach throughout the ready4 software suite;
- codifying a simple and consistent [syntax](../../../project/a_ready4-project/syntax/) for use in all [programs](../../../publications/programs/) that implement configurations of [models](../../../models/) developed with the ready4 framework.
