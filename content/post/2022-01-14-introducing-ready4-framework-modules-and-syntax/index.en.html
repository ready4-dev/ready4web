<p><strong>The <a href="../../../framework/">ready4 framework</a> has reached a major milestone with the launch of tools to implement modular models that use a simple and consistent syntax.</strong></p>
<p>Development version <a href="../../../publications_ov/software/">software</a> to implement and extend the ready4 framework has been publicly available for over a year now. However, up until now the implementation of this code has limited the potential utility of this code as a toolkit for developing transparent and modular mental health systems models. The latest release of the ready4 R package addresses these limitations with two important innovations:</p>
<ul>
<li>introducing the concept of <a href="../../../project/a_ready4-project/modules/">modules</a>, to facilitate consistent application of an <a href="https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4/articles/V_03.html">Object Oriented Programming</a> approach throughout the ready4 software suite;</li>
<li>codifying a simple and consistent <a href="../../../project/a_ready4-project/syntax/">syntax</a> for use in all <a href="../../../publications/programs/">programs</a> that implement configurations of <a href="../../../models/">models</a> developed with the ready4 framework.</li>
</ul>
