The [ready4 framework](../../../../framework/) facilitates a transparent approach to [mental health system model](../../../../project/f_readyforwhatsnext-project/) development by use of a simple and consistent syntax.

A description of the high level commands that comprise the ready4 framework syntax is available in the following vignette article from the [ready4 R package](../../../../tags/ready4-r-package/):

- https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4/articles/V_02.html

Underpinning the simple and parsimonious syntax for use in modelling programs is a much more diverse code base contained in framework libraries. This code is not routinely exposed to modellers, but is available to those who are interested, for example developers who wish to extend the ready4 framework by writing libraries. Resources to support a consistent house-style include:

- Vignete articles about [authoring functions](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4fun/articles/V_01.html), [authoring classes](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4class/articles/V_01.html) and [authoring R packages](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4pack/articles/V_01.html); and
