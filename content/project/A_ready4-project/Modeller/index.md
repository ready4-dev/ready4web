## Purpose
To provide tools for standardised development of datasets, programs and sub-routines that implement ready4 framework model configurations.

## Published output
Published work to date includes software.

### Software

Modellers can avail of the following development version R packages to implement bespoke configurations of ready4 framework models:

- [ready4use](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4use/index.html) (for authoring, curating and labelling datasets); and
- [ready4show](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4show/index.html) (for authoring self-documenting programs and sub-routines).


## Future releases
The priority for development of the framework is to improve the documentation and ease of use of the current framework toolkits and to prepare each R package for submission to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
