## Purpose
......

## Published output
Published work to date includes software and a dataset.

### Software

The bare bones [foundation of the ready4 framework](../project/a_ready4-project/) can be extended using tools contained in the following development version R packages:

- [ready4fun](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4fun/index.html), [ready4class](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4class/index.html) and [ready4pack](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4pack/index.html) (for authoring and documenting code libraries);
- [ready4show](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4show/index.html) (for authoring self-documenting programs); and 
- [ready4use](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4use/index.html) (for authoring, curating and labelling datasets).

### Dataset
Taxonomies, abbreviations and other meta-data to help implement the framework are available in [an online repository](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RIQTKK).

## Future releases
The priority for development of the framework is to improve the documentation and ease of use of the current framework toolkits and to prepare each R package for submission to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
