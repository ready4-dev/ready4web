## Purpose
The purpose of First Bounce is to model the processes and resource constraints of mental health service platforms.

## Published output
Published output to date takes the form of a report.

### Report
Some initial scoping work we undertook for this model was published as an expert opinion survey on [appropriate targeting of youth mental health services](https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2017/207/10/targeting-mental-health-care-attributes-diagnosis-and-clinical-stage-views).

## Future releases
The main development priority of First Bounce is to complete and release a discrete event simulation of Australian primary youth mental helath services.
