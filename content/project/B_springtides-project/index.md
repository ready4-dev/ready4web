## Purpose
Springtides is a model to synthesise geometry (boundary, coordinate) and spatial attribute (e.g. population counts, environmental characteristics, service identifier and model coefficients associated with areas) data. 

## Published output
Currently the main application of Springtides has been as a spatial epidemiology model that predicts the prevalence of a range of mental health and substance disorders for regions of Australia. Published work to date has taken the form of some reports and datasets.

### Reports
In collaboration with colleagues at the University of Sydney, Springtides was deployed early in the COVID-19 pandemic to [predict potential changes in the prevalence of mental disorders](https://www.orygen.org.au/About/News-And-Events/2020/Modelling-predicts-an-additional-82,000-young-Vict) in the absence of Government intervention. That analysis was reported in media coverage in [May](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/alarm-raised-over-pandemic-linked-mental-health-crisis-20200514-p54t2z.html) and [December](https://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/mental-health-of-young-must-be-a-post-virus-priority-20201212-p56mxk.html) 2020.

Some background about the model is provided in [this poster](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=4419934&version=1.0#) and from about the 55 minute mark of [this webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6g_DzBPOqo). 

### Dataset
Some of the input data of the demographic module of Springtides is available in an [online repository](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JHSCDJ).

## Future releases
The Springtides model is currently undergoing substantial redevelopment in preparation for a public release of its underlying code. Once that release occurs, future development will focus on broadening the focus of the data-packs associated with springtides (ie to include items other than demographic and prevalence rate parameters).
