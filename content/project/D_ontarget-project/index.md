## Purpose
The purpose of On Target is to model the costs, efficacy, budget impact and cost-effectiveness of mental health programs and interventions.

## Published output
Output released to date includes a Report and Software.

### Report
Our initial scoping of this topic was published in the form of a review of previously published evidence on the [cost-effectiveness of youth mental health service attributes](https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2017/207/10/identifying-attributes-care-may-improve-cost-effectiveness-youth-mental-health).

### Software
A (very preliminary) development version of the [bimp](https://ready4-dev.github.io/bimp/) R package to support the conduct of budget impact analyses is available online (not yet supported with adequate documentation though).

## Future releases
The main current development priorities are to 
- complete work on developing, testing and documenting the bimp package;
- update and broaden the review of cost-effectiveness evidence; and
- incorporate findings from the updated review with an interactive decision aid.
