The three categories of ready4 toolkits are:

 - [**Authoring toolkits**](../tags/authoring-toolkits) to help standardise and automate common code authoring and data management tasks;
 - [**Modelling toolkits**](../tags/modelling-toolkits) to help standardise and automate common mental health modelling tasks; and
 - [**Prediction toolkits**](../tags/prediction-toolkits) to help forecast population mental health outcomes under varying potential future states.

A number of the toolkits have been documented in a basic fashion by an algorithm we created as part of the [ready4fun](../post/ready4fun-bare-bones/) package (human written edits and extensions to this documentation will be produced in 2021) - and source code for these toolkits are now  publicly available  in our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/ready4-dev). A further set of toolkits are in the process of being documented and will be publicly released later in 2021.
