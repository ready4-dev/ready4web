Our datasets are currently hosted in [the ready4 section of the Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ready4). 

Our datasets are a combination of:

- [framework datasets](../../publications/datasets/framework/) (taxonomies used to help standardise projects developed using the ready4 framework); and

- [model datasets](../../publications/datasets/model/) (input and output data for modelling studies); and

- [instructional datasets](../../publications/datasets/instructional/) (synthetic [fake] data used to demonstrate the generalised application of model algorithms).
