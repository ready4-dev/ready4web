## Purpose
ready4 is a framework for open and modular development of mental health systems models. It provides a set of tools to enable models of [people](/project/c_springtolife-project/),  [places](/project/b_springtides-project/), [platforms](/project/e_firstbounce-project/) and [programs](/project/d_ontarget-project/) to be flexibly combined as modules of an overarching [systems model](/project/f_readyforwhatsnext-project/).

## Published output
Published work to date includes software and a dataset.

### Software

The foundation of the ready4 framework is provided by the [ready4](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4/) R package (development version).

The bare-bones framework provided by `ready4` can be extended using tools contained in the following development version R packages:

- [ready4fun](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4fun/index.html), [ready4class](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4class/index.html) and [ready4pack](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4pack/index.html) (for authoring and documenting code libraries);
- [ready4show](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4show/index.html) (for authoring self-documenting programs); and 
- [ready4use](https://ready4-dev.github.io/ready4use/index.html) (for authoring, curating and labelling datasets).

### Dataset
Taxonomies, abbreviations and other meta-data to help implement the framework are available in [an online repository](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RIQTKK).

## Future releases
The priority for development of the framework is to improve the documentation and ease of use of the current framework toolkits and to prepare each R package for submission to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
