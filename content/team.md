The readyforwhatsnext project was seeded with funding by VicHealth, Orygen and Victoria University and is led by researchers in Orygen's Health Service and Outcomes Research unit.

The overarching readyforwhatsnext model is being developed using a modular approach in which sub-models, each of which are independently funded and governed, adopt a common framework so that they can be flexibly combined. To date, these constituent sub-models have involved collaborations with colleagues at Deakin University, Flinders University, Monash University, Victoria University and the University of Sydney amongst others, with additional funders including headspace and Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council. 

Currently, the core technical development group for the toolkits that implement this framework is small, with all code to date written by [Matthew Hamilton](https://mph-economist.netlify.app/), Caroline Gao and Glen Wiesner. 
Consistent with the collaborative nature of this project, a number of contributors to this project also work to develop the mental health modelling field as part of Australia's [National Mental Health Systems Modelling Network](https://qcmhr.org/research/research-streams/policy-and-epidemiology-research-stream/mental-health-services-research/national-mental-health-systems-modelling-network/)
