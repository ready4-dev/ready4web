title: About
---

ready4 is an open science framework for modular, replicable and generalisable mental health modelling. The development of the ready4 framework is being led by the Health Services and Outcomes Research unit at Orygen. 

The ready4 framework is an output of the [readyforwhatsnext](https://readyforwhatsnext.github.io/readyforwhatsnext/index.html) project that has been funded by VicHealth, Orygen and Victoria University and which is led by researchers in Orygen, Victoria University, Deakin University and Flinders University. The framework is being applied to and developed in conjunction with projects from other funders, who are identified in each project page.

The primary contact for the project is Matthew Hamilton (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
