title: Documenting the development of an open source mental health systems model
---

ready4-dev is a website that documents the development of readyforwhatsnext - an open source model of the systems that shape the mental health of young people. The website provides information about:

- the background and motivation for the project, the people behind it and how you can contribute;
- the governing conceptual and technical framework for the development of the project;
- the sub-component models of the places, people, platforms and programs that will constitute the overarching readyforwhatsnext systems model; and
- the outputs produced to date by the project in terms of software (programs and libraries), datasets (real and synthetic) and insights (scientific summaries and reports).
