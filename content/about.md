description: ready4 - a framework for replicable, modular and generalisable mental health models.
title: The ready4 framework
---

ready4 is an open science framework for modular, replicable and generalisable mental health modelling. The motivation for the ready4 framework is to provide the conceptual and technical support to develop  [readyforwhatsnext - an open source mental health simulation model](../readyforwhatsnext/). 

We have developed the ready4 framework so that the readyforwhatsnext model can be developed iteratively and collaboratively. In particular, the ready4 framework aims to support modelling projects that are:

- **Modular** - multiple modelling projects and their algorithm and data sub-components can be combined to model more extensive systems and undertake more comprehensive analysis;
- **Replicable** - model algorithms and data are freely available to others so that they can reproduce results and verify model validity; and
- **Generalisable** - model algorithms and data-structures are sufficiently abstracted to have multiple applications, so that models can be more readily adapted to a range of spatio-temporal and decision contexts.

The current version of the ready4 framework consists of development versions of a range of open access [toolkits](../toolkits/) and [datasets](../datasets/). Furthermore, each of the [models](../categories/models/) developed with the framework is also a module of the overarching readyforwhatsnext model.

The readyforwhatsnext project has been funded by VicHealth, Orygen and Victoria University and led by researchers in Orygen's Health Service and Outcomes Research unit in collaboration with colleagues at Deakin University, Flinders University and Victoria University. The framework is being also being applied to develop a number of projects funded from other sources and led by other project teams involving a large group of collaborators. Although of these projects are formally independent of each other, the shared ready4 development framework means that there is significant re-use of algorithms and data between projects.

Currently, the core technical development group for the toolkits that implement this framework is small, with all code to date written by [Matthew Hamilton](https://github.com/matthewphamilton), Caroline Gao and Glen Wiesner. Consistent with the collaborative nature of this project, a number of team members contribute to developing the mental health modelling field as part of Australia's [National Mental Health Systems Modelling Network](https://qcmhr.org/research/research-streams/policy-and-epidemiology-research-stream/mental-health-services-research/national-mental-health-systems-modelling-network/)

We also welcome approaches from potential collaborators interested in contributing to the development of the project - contact Matthew Hamilton (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
