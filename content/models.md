Our modelling approach is to develop one overarching [systems model](../categories/models-systems/) that synthesises four [system section models](../categories/models-system-sections/).

The sections of the overarching model are:

- [Spring To Life](../project/c_springtolife-project/): A model of people;
- [Springtides](../project/b_springtides-project/): A model of places;
- [First Bounce](../project/e_firstbounce-project/): A model of services; and
- [On Target](../project/d_ontarget-project/): A model of programs

The model that synthesises all these system section models is:

- [readyforwhatsnext](../project/f_readyforwhatsnext-project/): A youth mental health systems model of people, places, services and programs
