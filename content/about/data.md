To the greatest extent possible, projects developped with the ready4 framework will include freely available replication datasets. We have begut the process of preparing a number of these datasets for public dissemination, all of which will be hosted on our [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ready4). The first dataset that we have publicly released (which currently contains only synthetic data) is the [AQoL-6D transfer to utility algorithms](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JC6PTV,) dataset.
