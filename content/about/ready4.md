## Aims and Scope

ready4 is an open science toolkit for reproducible, replicable and generalisable mental health modelling.

ready4 consists of open access code libraries and datasets.

Most of the code libraries in the ready4 suite are currently hosted on GitHub in development versions that are being prepared for documentation prior to public release. A number of them have been documented in a basic fashion by an algorithm we created (human written edits and extensions to this documentation will be produced in 2021) - and are now publicly available. Source code for all of the above is available in our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/ready4-dev).

The initial ready4 suite (all Development workflow tools and some Modelling and Prediction tools) is an outcome of the [readyforwhatsnext](https://readyforwhatsnext.github.io/readyforwhatsnext/index.html) project that has been funded by VicHealth, Orygen and Victoria University and which is led by researchers in Orygen, Victoria University, Deakin University and Flinders University. The suite is expanding with outputs from other projects and funders, who are identified in each project page.
