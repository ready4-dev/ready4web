Our software programs can be self-contained or be sub-routines. 

[Self-contained programs](../categories/software-programs-self-contained/) can be executed in their current form without the need for additional input data and, unless modified, will always generate the exact same output. 

[Sub-routine programs](../categories/software-programs-subroutines/) need to be supplied with additional input data when they are called and will produce output that varies based on input values. All our programs implement literate programming techniques â€“ they are written in R Markdown and will generate documents in file formats such as PDF.
