We have developed the ready4 framework so that the readyforwhatsnext model can be developed iteratively and collaboratively. In particular, the ready4 framework aims to support modelling projects that are:

- **Modular** - multiple modelling projects and their algorithm and data sub-components can be combined to model more extensive systems and undertake more comprehensive analysis;
- **Replicable** - model algorithms and data are freely available to others so that they can reproduce results and verify model validity; and
- **Generalisable** - model algorithms and data-structures are sufficiently abstracted to have multiple applications, so that models can be more readily adapted to a range of spatio-temporal and decision contexts.

The current version of the ready4 framework consists of development versions of a range of open access [software](../software/) and [datasets](../data/). Furthermore, each of the [models](../categories/models/) developed with the framework is also a module of the overarching readyforwhatsnext model.
