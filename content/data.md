ready4 datasets that are currently freely available include:

- [Package datasets](../categories/package-datasets/) that are bundled as part of the R code-libraries that comprise ready4 [toolkits](../toolkits/). These are typically quite small in file size and may include synthetic agent populations.
- [Dataverse datasets](../categories/dataverse-datasets/) hosted within our collection of [Dataverses](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ready4). These datasets can include larger size files and may include the shareable versions of model analysis results.
