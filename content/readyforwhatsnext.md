title: readyforwhatsnext - modelling better futures for young people.
---

readyforwhatsnext is an open source simulation model to help identify policies that can better support the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people.

We are developing readyforwhatsnext as an open source project due to the complexity inherent in mental health systems. We think such complexity argues for modelling approaches that are:
- **collaborative** - the diverse expertise, perspectives, data and algorithms of multiple teams contribute to model development and cross-validation, facilitated by a shared purpose and common set of tools and standards;
- **iterative** - projects initially model simple representations of systems and, over time, to progressively grow the number, scope and validity of these sub-component models and link them together. 

For, these reasons we have started by developing the [ready4 framework for modular, replicable and generalisable mental health modelling](../about/). We are now applying that framework to the development of multiple [models](../categories/models/), all of which will be progressively combined as modules of the overarching readyforwhatsnext model. 

The first application of the readyforwhatsnext model will be to explore the potential costs and impacts of a range of policy options to improve the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people in Victoria, Australia. That iteration of readyforwhatsnext is being developed as a hybrid of systems dynamics (for modelling demographic change) and agent based (for modelling the behaviours and outcomes of individuals and households) approaches. To date, the project has achieved milestones that include the release of [toolkits](../../categories/readyforwhatsnext-toolkits) and [datasets](../../categories/readyforwhatsnext-datasets), development of a [conceptual model](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=4419933&version=1.0), stakeholder consultations, creation of a synthetic dataset representative of Victorian households (to be released once a related manuscript is publised) and the initial version of the [systems dynamics component of the model](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=4419934&version=1.0).
