description: ready4 - a framework for replicable, modular and generalisable mental health models.
title: Purpose
---

ready4 is an open science framework for modular, replicable and generalisable mental health modelling. 

The motivation for the ready4 framework is the need to develop models that adequately address the complexity inherent in mental health systems. One response to such a significant challenge is to initially model simple representations of individual sub-components of these systems and, over time, to progressively grow the number, scope and validity of these sub-component models and to link them together. 

That is the approach we prefer, but it calls for many hands and medium to long term timeframes. It also requires striking a balance between diverse research teams working competitively to solve distinct modelling challenges and the need to adopt common standards and frameworks to add coherence and efficiency to the collective efforts of the field. We have developped the ready4 framework to help make such a vision more achievable, with an emphasis on supporting the development of modelling projects that are:

- **Modular** - i.e. multiple modelling projects and their algorithm and data sub-components can be combined to model more extensive systems and undertake more comprehensive analysis;
- **Replicable** - model algorithms and data are freely available to others so that they can reproduce results and verify model validity; and
- **Generalisable** - model algorithms and data-structures are sufficiently abstracted to have multiple applications, so that models can be more readily adapted to a range of spatio-temporal and decision contexts.

The current version of the ready4 framework consists of development versions of a range of open access [toolkits](../toolkits/) and [datasets](../datasets/) that support the development mental health models with these attributes.
